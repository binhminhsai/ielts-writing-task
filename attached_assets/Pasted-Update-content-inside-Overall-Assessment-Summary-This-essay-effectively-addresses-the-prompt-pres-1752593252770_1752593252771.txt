“Summary This essay effectively addresses the prompt, presenting both views and a clear, well-supported opinion. The lexical resource and grammatical range and accuracy are strong, demonstrating good control over language. However, the most significant limitation is the complete lack of paragraphing. Presenting the entire essay as a single block of text severely impacts the Coherence and Cohesion score, making the logical progression harder for the reader to follow, despite the underlying organization of ideas. Addressing this structural flaw is crucial for achieving a higher band score.

Specific Suggestions
* The absolute top priority for improvement is to format the essay into clear, distinct paragraphs. This is fundamental for IELTS writing.
* Practice paragraphing: write topic sentences for each body paragraph that clearly state its main idea.

Vocabulary Enhancement
* For discussions on government spending, consider terms like fiscal policy, public funds, resource allocation, infrastructure development.
* When talking about balance, compromise, middle ground, optimal resource distribution could be useful.

Grammar Focus
* No specific grammar errors were frequent; the focus should be on maintaining the current high level of accuracy.
* Continue to practice using a variety of complex sentence structures, ensuring each clause is correctly formed and linked.

Next Steps
* Master Paragraphing: Practice writing essays where you consciously separate your introduction, each body paragraph, and conclusion.
* Essay Structure Drills: For future essays, outline your paragraph structure before writing (e.g., Paragraph 1: Intro. Paragraph 2: View 1. Paragraph 3: View 2. Paragraph 4: Opinion/Conclusion).
* Review Band Descriptors: Pay close attention to the Coherence and Cohesion band descriptors, specifically how paragraphing impacts clarity and logical progression.”
